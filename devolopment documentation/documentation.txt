Hello, welcome to the inside thoughts and documentation of the owner Danni.

Firstly, if you are reading this, smart.

Secondly here is the internal thoughs, diolouge, updates, annd documentation on how I (Danni) built this website while going through college.

I understand this website looks like it is straight out of 1995-1999 I'm still learning HTML, CSS, JS, ect.

I had purchased the URL's dannikitsune.com and danniarcticfox.com early Febuary 2024.

Now onto the documentation section.
