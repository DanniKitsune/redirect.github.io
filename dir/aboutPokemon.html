  <p>Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," is a multimedia franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori, which debuted in 1996 with the release of Pokémon Red and Green for the Nintendo Game Boy in Japan. The games, developed by Game Freak, revolve around capturing and training fictional creatures called Pokémon, and battling them against other trainers. Players take on the role of Pokémon trainers on a quest to become the Pokémon Champion by defeating other trainers and conquering various Pokémon Gyms.<br><br>

  Pokémon has had a profound impact on gaming and popular culture worldwide. It pioneered the concept of trading and battling Pokémon with friends via link cables, fostering social interactions among players. The franchise's emphasis on collection and strategy has influenced numerous other games, particularly in the RPG and monster-collecting genres.<br><br>

  Furthermore, Pokémon's cultural impact extends beyond gaming, with its iconic characters becoming global symbols recognized by people of all ages. The franchise's enduring popularity has led to countless spin-off games, merchandise, a highly successful trading card game, and a massively successful augmented reality mobile game, Pokémon GO, which became a cultural phenomenon upon its release in 2016.
